The game is structured around the start screen, the active game, and the game-over screen. The creator used JSON format to manage her sound and animation data in the assets in order to store and access them. It helps people to find the critical code easier. She also created a reset button that can bring the player back to the starting scene. This ending UI does a good job of returning the game mood and encourages the player to start another round. The visual detail of the heart emoji above the cat makes each catch feel the sense of accomplishment instead of monotonous scoring, which fits the overall cute theme.

This version of frog-frog-frog project builds a rich gaming system that provides a creative experience for viewers. What makes it  unique is the competitive system between the frog(controlled by the player) and the Gluttinous Toad. The toad constantly drifts toward the fly vertically in moveToa, tracks the fly’s y position by function (toad.body.y += diffY / 60), creates pressure that if the player misses, the fly is likely to drift into the toad’s mouth instead. As the toad grow larger, players have to take more flies before the toad finally win.

Instead of just a “press to start” text, this frog-frog-frog project makes the frog’s mouth grows to swallow the whole screen when the player holds the mouse. Only once the mouth fully expands does the game stars. This creates a fun and dramatic entering scene  and ties the UI with the frog’s theme. The feed back system is also creative. The frog's face shifts based on how high the score players can achieve. The higher people get, the happier the frog looks. If the player did not manage to catch any of the flies, the game even switches to a full “frog death” tombstone scene, complete with R.I.P text and a cross, creates a dramatic effect for players.

The creator added a motivate system. Each new asteroid spawns with randomized size, color tone, and speed that make sure the gameplay never gets predictable. The sound design adds a surprising amount of energy. Firing the laser, hitting an asteroid, losing a life, and completing the goal all trigger corresponding sound effects. The score increases only after the laser is confirmed to have hit an asteroid, and the hitting logic uses boolean (laser.hit = true) to determine the true or false scoring for every single shot.
