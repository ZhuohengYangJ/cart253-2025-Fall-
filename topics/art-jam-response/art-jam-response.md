The creator managed to achieved the smooth transition between day and night by using if{} and  else{} conditionals. The height of the eyes and the pupil size are both based on the transition of the background: the darker it gets, the tighter these eyes closed. It combines creative design choices that make a simple face looks sleepy during the night and turns into high spirits during daytime. Besides, the waving hand follows mouseX and mouseY which can either wave to people in the morning and do a yawning face in the night, adds a layer of playful human presence. Overall, the work successfully created a logical and interesting face with practical mechanism based on conditional as well as variable knowledge we learned so far. The piece represents a strong example of how computational art can communicate mood, rhythm, and personality.

The creator designed an abstract cycle that represented each part of his physical body with rotating black circles. Once the mouse guides the cross onto one of the circle, the entire page turns into contrasting x-ray-like color. This work shows the strong self-awareness from the creator that combines his imaginative application of computational technic. The crosshair-like X/Y tracking lines, tied to cursor position, function as a camera interface: as the user moves, the interface aims. The creator calculated the rotation translation effect with the trigonometric formula carefully with sin() and cos() so that each bubble is centered to the canvas. Overall, the work is compelling for its emotional and technical precision, inviting viewers to consider how the digital environment influenced both self-perception and self-awareness.

The character in this work becomes visibly happier when the lights are off and the curtain covers them. The craetor manged to use if(hoverCurtain && mousePressed) as a condition to shift the face as well as the background color, which makes the "Shy guy who is very shy" only dares to smile when the lights are off. In conclusion, the project  demonstrates impressive technical control, using constraints and position tracking to ensure smooth, natural movements of both the curtain and the character. This piece stands out for the creators ability to transform simple shapes and logical conditions into an expressive narrative about social-anxiety, comfort, and human connection.
