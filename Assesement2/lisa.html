    <p>
    Web 1.0 is often described as the “read-only” Web. It was characterized by static web pages with very limited user
    interaction. Most websites served as online brochures or repositories of information, where users could view content but
    could not easily contribute or modify it.

    <p>
    This early stage of the Web was dominated by institutional and corporate websites that provided information but offered
    little opportunity for collaboration or participation.
